Are you interested in exploring Linux but hesitant to leave the comfort of your Windows environment? The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) offers a seamless way to run a Linux distribution alongside your Windows system without the need for dual-boot setups or virtual machines. This guide will walk you through the process of installing, configuring, and using WSL to get the best of both worlds.

## What is WSL?

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) is a compatibility layer developed by Microsoft that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows. It enables you to execute Linux command-line tools and applications alongside your Windows applications. WSL comes in two versions:

* **WSL 1**: Translates Linux system calls into Windows system calls.
* **WSL 2**: Introduces a full Linux kernel running in a lightweight virtual machine, offering improved performance and full system call compatibility.

**WSL 2** is the recommended version for most users due to its enhanced capabilities.

## Installing WSL

**Step 1: Enable WSL**

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as an <mark>administrator</mark>.

2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

   This command will enable the necessary features and install the default Linux distribution (**Ubuntu**).

3. Restart your computer when prompted.

> For detailed instructions, refer to the official Microsoft documentation: [Install WSL ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

**Step 2: Set Up Your Linux Distribution**

After restarting, launch the installed Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) from the Start menu. The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to create a new `user account` and `password` for your Linux environment.

## Understanding WSL Architecture

WSL 2 utilizes virtualization technology to run a real Linux kernel inside a lightweight utility virtual machine (VM). This architecture provides full system call compatibility, improved performance, and the ability to run more complex Linux applications.

  <span style="margin-top: 8px; font-style: italic; color: #555; ">Figure 1: WSL 2 Architecture </span>
</div>

Key features of WSL 2 include:

* **Full Linux Kernel**: Provides complete compatibility with Linux applications.
* **Improved File System Performance**: Faster file system operations compared to WSL 1.
* **Docker Support**: Ability to run Docker containers natively.

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Using WSL</h2>

**Launching WSL**

You can launch your WSL distribution in several ways:

* **Start Menu**: Search for your installed distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) and click to open.
* **Command Line**: Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and type:

  ```powershell
  wsl
  ```

This will open your default WSL distribution.

### Running Linux Commands

Once inside the WSL terminal, you can execute Linux commands as you would on a native Linux system. For example:

```bash
> sudo apt update
```

These commands update the package list (do it when setting first time compulsory, then periodically when needed), respectively.

### Accessing Windows Files from WSL (Optional)

WSL allows you to access your Windows file system. For example, your C: drive is mounted at `/mnt/c/`. You can navigate to your desktop using:

```bash
> cd /mnt/c/Users/<YourUsername>/Desktop
```

Currently, not advised to make any changes to Windows System through wsl. <mark>It is advised to always start with `/` [ root folder ]</mark> To navigate to root folder (in WSL), look at the following Example, 

```bash
> C:\Users\ganes>wsl

> [ganesh@Ganesh-PC ganes]$ cd /

> [ganesh@Ganesh-PC /]$ ls
  afs  boot  etc   init  lib64   media   opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
  dev   home  lib   lost+found   mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var

> [ganesh@Ganesh-PC /]$
```

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Customizing WSL</h2>

**Installing Specific Linux Distribution**

WSL supports multiple Linux distributions. To view available distributions, run:

```powershell
> wsl --list --online
```

To install a specific distribution, use:

```powershell
> wsl --install -d <DistributionName>
```

Replace `<DistributionName>` with the name of the distribution <mark>if you wish to install</mark>.

### Setting the Default Distribution

If you have multiple distributions installed, you can set the default in (`powershell`) using:

```powershell
wsl --set-default <DistributionName>
```

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Integrating WSL with Development Tools</h3>


WSL can be integrated with various development tools to enhance your workflow:

* **Visual Studio Code**: Use the Remote - WSL extension to develop within WSL.
* **Git**: Install and configure Git within WSL for version control.
* **Docker**: Run Docker containers natively within WSL 2.



## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **WSL Not Installing Properly**: Ensure that virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
* **Permission Issues**: Run your terminal as an administrator when performing system-level operations.
* **Network Connectivity**: Restart the WSL service or your computer to resolve network-related issues.



## Conclusion

The Windows Subsystem for Linux provides a powerful and convenient way to run a Linux environment directly on your Windows machine. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or just curious about Linux, WSL offers a seamless integration that enhances your productivity without the need for dual-boot setups or virtual machines.
