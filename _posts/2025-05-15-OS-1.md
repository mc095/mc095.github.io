excerpt: "Welcome to the first step of our Linux OS from Scratch journey. Today we answer what most beginners never dare to ask: What is an Operating System, and why do we even need one?"
---

An **Operating System (OS)** is a specialized software layer that serves as the intermediary between a computer’s hardware and its users or applications. It manages hardware resources and provides a stable, standardized environment for software execution. Without an OS, users would need to directly interact with complex hardware instructions, making computing impractical for most.

</div>


Imagine a bustling city (your computer) with citizens (applications) and infrastructure (hardware like CPU, memory, and storage). The mayor (OS) ensures that roads (resources) are used efficiently, traffic (processes) flows smoothly, and utilities (devices) are accessible. The mayor translates citizens’ requests (user commands) into actionable tasks for the city’s workers (hardware).

### Why Do We Need an OS?
The OS solves two fundamental challenges:
1. **Hardware Complexity**: Hardware components, such as CPUs, memory, and storage devices, operate using low-level instructions (binary code). The OS abstracts these complexities, allowing users and developers to interact with the system using high-level commands or graphical interfaces.
   
2. **Resource Management**: Computers have finite resources (CPU time, memory, storage). The OS allocates these resources efficiently among multiple applications, ensuring fair access and preventing conflicts.

## Core Functions of an Operating System

The OS performs several critical functions to ensure smooth operation of a computer system. Below, we explore each function with examples and analogies.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/blog/2025-05-15-Intro-OS/2.png" alt="os-1" style="width: 100%;" />
  <span style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:30px; font-style: italic; color: #555;">Figure 3: Services of Operating System</span>
</div>


<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Process Management</h4>
Imagine the operating system as a highly skilled air traffic controller managing a bustling airport. Each plane attempting to take off or land represents a process, an instance of a running program, like your web browser or a calculator.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@dotlottie/player-component@2.7.12/dist/dotlottie-player.mjs" type="module"></script>
<dotlottie-player src="https://lottie.host/d4917547-f3ca-4e91-a4e5-3d16d58fb220/odZ22Y5qXH.lottie" background="transparent" speed="1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" loop autoplay></dotlottie-player>
</div>

The OS acts as the central authority, scheduling these processes for takeoff (CPU usage) and landing, ensuring smooth and collision-free operation. It employs sophisticated algorithms, such as Round-Robin Scheduling, to allocate CPU time fairly among the waiting processes, giving each a slice of attention in turn. 

This rapid switching between processes creates the illusion of multitasking, allowing you to seamlessly juggle activities like listening to music while writing in a text editor. The OS orchestrates this complex dance, ensuring that each application gets its turn to use the computer's processing power without stepping on another's toes.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Memory Management</h4>
Think of your computer's Random Access Memory (RAM) as a crucial kitchen workspace with limited counter space. When you open different applications (processes), the operating system acts like a meticulous chef, assigning specific areas of this counter space to each dish being prepared. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@dotlottie/player-component@2.7.12/dist/dotlottie-player.mjs" type="module"></script>
<dotlottie-player src="https://lottie.host/894338e6-3ae2-40bc-bef1-6bba940ea216/Qo08GCYkXU.lottie" background="transparent" speed="1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" loop autoplay></dotlottie-player>
</div>


It diligently keeps track of which ingredients (data) belong to which dish and ensures that no process accidentally spills into another's designated area. Furthermore, when the counter space (RAM) becomes scarce due to numerous open applications, the OS employs a clever technique called virtual memory. 

It's akin to the chef temporarily moving some less actively used ingredients to a nearby pantry (storage) to free up counter space, bringing them back only when needed. This allows you to work with more applications and data than could physically fit in RAM at once.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">3. File System </h4>
Envision the operating system as a highly organized librarian overseeing a vast library filled with countless books (files) stored on numerous shelves (storage devices like hard drives or SSDs). The OS establishes a logical structure, the file system (like NTFS in Windows or ext4 in Linux), to arrange these books into sections and subsections (directories or folders). 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@dotlottie/player-component@2.7.12/dist/dotlottie-player.mjs" type="module"></script>
<dotlottie-player src="https://lottie.host/32cff4fa-3af3-4451-a9d7-28856c8809c1/H1fyZ23xPm.lottie" background="transparent" speed="1.5" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" loop autoplay></dotlottie-player>
</div>

Each book also has a catalog card (metadata) containing essential information such as its title, author (file name, size, permissions), and location on the shelves. The librarian ensures that you can easily find and retrieve any book you need by maintaining this organized system. 

When you save a document, the OS diligently records its location within this file system, allowing you to effortlessly access it later using a file explorer, much like finding a specific book using the library's catalog.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Device Management</h4>
Consider the operating system as a multilingual and highly capable tour guide assisting you in interacting with various local vendors (hardware devices) during your travels. Each vendor speaks a different language (hardware-specific protocols), making direct communication challenging. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@dotlottie/player-component@2.7.12/dist/dotlottie-player.mjs" type="module"></script>
<dotlottie-player src="https://lottie.host/cdb672b3-c39c-46aa-be1b-34068294c4f8/5Ukp4ybEkr.lottie" background="transparent" speed="1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" loop autoplay></dotlottie-player>
</div>

This is where device drivers come in, acting as fluent translators between the OS (the tour guide) and each device (vendor). The OS provides a unified way for applications to communicate with diverse hardware like keyboards, mice, and printers, abstracting away the intricate technical details of each device. 

For instance, when you want to print a document, the OS doesn't need to know the specific language of your printer model. Instead, it communicates with the printer's driver, which then translates the print request into a language the printer understands, ensuring your document is printed correctly.

<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Security and Access Control</h4>
Picture the operating system as a vigilant security guard stationed at the entrance of a secure building, safeguarding valuable assets (data and system resources). The OS enforces strict security protocols to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing these protected areas. It manages user authentication, like checking your ID (password or biometric scan) to verify your identity before granting entry. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@dotlottie/player-component@2.7.12/dist/dotlottie-player.mjs"></script>
  <dotlottie-player src="https://lottie.host/3df63b38-b40d-4773-99ab-110c40056a46/sDYJVc7e5G.lottie" background="transparent" speed="1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" loop autoplay></dotlottie-player>
</div>

Furthermore, it controls file permissions, determining who has the authority to view, modify, or execute specific files and resources within the system, much like restricting access to certain rooms within the building. The OS also acts as the first line of defense against external threats like malware, constantly monitoring for suspicious activity to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the system and its data. 

In operating systems like Linux, this is evident in how the OS restricts access to critical system files, such as the /etc/passwd file containing user account information, limiting access to only users with administrative privileges.





## The Need for Abstraction

Without an OS, developers would need to write hardware-specific code for every application, a time-consuming and error-prone process. The OS provides a **layer of abstraction**, offering standardized interfaces (e.g., APIs) that simplify development.

Imagine if every appliance (application) required a unique plug design to connect to power (hardware). You’d need countless adapters! The OS is like a universal power outlet, allowing appliances to plug in easily without worrying about the power plant’s (hardware’s) inner workings.

Let's say a game developer can use OS-provided graphics APIs (e.g., OpenGL) to render visuals without needing to understand the GPU’s architecture. Similarly, a music player uses OS file system calls to access audio files, regardless of the storage device type.

## Types of Operating Systems

Operating systems vary in design and purpose. Below, we compare two popular OS families: **Windows** and **Linux**.
